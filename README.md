# LPCXpresso-Project
Embedded Systems Project

This project consists of monitoring the light sensor,
temperature sensor and trim potentiometer and
displaying the values on the OLED display.
There is an option for the user to record the values in a specific time value, which also can be chosen.

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC17xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC17xx
- MCU_Lib        	 : for LPC17xx peripheral driver files
- EaBaseBoard_Lib    : for Embedded Artists LPCXpresso Base Board peripheral drivers

These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
